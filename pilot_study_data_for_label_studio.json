[{"data": {"Q_fullText": "I will try to answer specifically to your last question because I am more knowledgable on the experimental aspects of gravitational physics.\n\n  As you may know, the CMB is the oldest radiation that we can see in the universe. It can be referred to as the surface of last scattering for photons and it coincides with the moment the universe stopped to be an ionized plasma and became transparent: at the beginning, the universe was super hot but at the time of the CMB (epoch of recombination) the temperature lowered enough for neutral hydrogen to form.\n\n  It happened approximately 380 thousand years after the Big Bang, which means that no matter how good or big \"telescopes\" are, we cannot probe anything closer than that to the Big Bang with electromagnetic radiation.\n\n  This is not the case with gravitational waves. Gravitational waves would allow us to peer into regions inaccessible to EM radiation and much closer to the Big Bang: this could potentially unravel the nature of the earliest moments of our universe.\n\n  Cosmologists predict that the gravitational waves generated by inflation are not deterministic signals like the inspiral waveforms already measured by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration, but rather they should appear like a stochastic background. As it is often done with noise, it makes more sense to analyze stochastic signals in the frequency domain. In the frequency domain, the stochastic gravitational will have a power spectrum. The features of this spectrum depend highly on the model considered, but in general, there is an agreement that it would be \"whitish\", i.e. it would extend across a wide interval of frequencies.\n\n  At the moment ground-based detectors, which are sensitive around the audio frequencies, have not claimed a measurement of the stochastic GW background. Such detectors are tuned to see the inspiral and merger of compact objects and GW from Supernovae, which in the past were the most likely sources of GW, and were not designed to look for the mysterious signal of the primordial gravitational waves. That is understandable: if you want to do something that no one has ever done before, you might as well give you the better chances to succeed by aiming at sources you are pretty confident exist.\n\n  LISA, a planned space-based detector, is sensitive in a lower frequency band ($10^{-5}$ to $10^{-2}\\,\\mbox{Hz}$ approximately). There is some optimism regarding the detectability of primordial GW with LISA, but it is not the principal science goal of the mission.\n\n  Furthermore, LISA will be signal dominated and the presence of a stochastic background will be buried under thousands of other deterministic signals which will have to be subtracted one by one. Another complication is that LISA will be sensitive to another background: the background of unresolvable galactic sources (like binary systems of white dwarfs). This further effect could be orders of magnitudes larger than the stochastic background of primordial GW.\n\n  As mentioned, primordial GW could have left an imprint in the CMB: the most promising signature of this effect is clearly a \u201ccurl-like\u201d (B-mode) polarization pattern in CMB polarization (cited from Gravitational waves from inflation, <PERSON> et al., 2016).\n\n  Finally, also pulsar timing arrays are analyzing to give upper limits on the parameters of the stochastic GW power spectrum.\n\n  A good (and probably a little tough) reference for your question is the review Gravitational waves from inflation, by <PERSON> et al. (https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01615).\n\n  A presentation about the topic by one of the authors is also available at https://www.sif.it/static/SIF/resources/public/files/congr16/mc/Guzzetti.pdf\n\n  Edit to include some mechanism of primordial GW production\n\n  To my knowledge, one of the basic mechanisms to produce GW in the inflation epoch is the following. The origin of the CMB anisotropies, which are the seeds of the structure that we see today in the universe, according to the cosmologists, resided in quantum fluctuations of the fields that describe the dynamics of the universe during inflation.\n\n  Therefore the accelerated expansion of the inflationary scenario was not \"perfect\" but there was some sort of perturbations. Both scalar perturbations and tensor perturbations could have been generated: the former are related to fluctuations the energy density of the Universe, while the latter constitute the real degrees of freedom of the gravitational field, i.e. gravitational waves.\n\n  In the paper I linked, the authors present several mechanisms to produce gravitational waves during inflation and the preheating phase. All such mechanisms can be divided into two categories\n\n   1.

If a photon impinges on my detector, I measure a voltage spike at the output.\n\n  If my detector were ideal, that is if its response time were zero, every time a photon arrives I have a voltage pulse and I count all photons.\n\n  Unfortunately, the response time of my system is not zero, but rather a given value thet we call $\\delta t$.\n\n  If a photon impinges at a time $t_0$ and a second photon within the time window $t_0\\le t \\le t_0 + \\delta t$, I miss it because the system is still \"blinded\" by the first photon.\n\n  I am trying to figure out how to estimate the number of missed photons due to the response time $\\delta t$, in order to correct the rate of photons that I measure for this effect.\n\n  The Hamamatsu PMT handbook (that can be found at this link) in chapter 6, section 3c (page 145 for your convenience) explains that you can estimate the number of missed photons in the following way.\n\n  Assuming that the true rate of photons is $N$ (units of counts per unit time), the measured rate is $M$ (also units of counts per unit time), and the time interval in which the sensor is blind after a successful detection is $\\delta t$, we can compute the dead time of the detector per unit time as $T_{dead} = M\\cdot \\delta t$. From this we can compute the number of missed points per unit time (loss counts rate) $N-M$ as \\begin{equation} N-M = N \\cdot T_{dead} = N\\cdot M\\cdot \\delta t \\end{equation} From this equation, it is possible to recover the true photon rate as \\begin{equation} N = \\frac{M}{1-M\\cdot \\delta t} \\end{equation}\n\n  This calculation although reasonable, in my opinion, assumes that the inter-arrival times $\\Delta T_i$ of the photons, that is the time that passes between a photon arriving on the detector and the subsequent, are uniformly distributed.\n\n  However, the detection of photons is generally considered a <PERSON> process, hence the inter-arrival times are exponentially distributed. \\begin{equation} \\Delta T_i \\sim N e^{-N \\cdot t}, \\end{equation} where once again $N$ is the true rate of photons. The exponential distribution tells us that small inter-arrival are more likely than long inter-arrival times. This makes it so that in the time window $\\delta t$ where the detector is still blind from the previous pulse statistically it is more likely to have a second photon compared to a time window of the same length at later times.\n\n  My attempted correction to the loss counts rate formula if the inter-arrival times of the photons are exponentially distributed would be \\begin{equation} N-M = N\\cdot M\\cdot \\delta t \\frac{N\\delta_t}{1-e^{-N\\delta t}} \\quad \\xrightarrow[]{\\quad N\\to \\,0\\quad}\\quad N\\cdot M\\cdot \\delta t \\end{equation}\n\n  In the limit of the rate $N$ going to zero, the exponential distribution becomes a uniform distribution and I recover the previous formula (as expected)\n\n  I came up with this formula as intuition and I am not sure if it is right. I wanted to check with the community if it is right.\n\n  A quick simulation seems to hint that the formula is correct, as you can see in the plot below ($\\delta t = 100\\,n\\mbox{s}$).", "a0_documentID": "cb1b05f0-b502-57f1-9f7a-6d161b8b2919", "a0_authorID": "0b01d356-42d8-0892-b058-efdbe26dadd1", "a0_style": "", "a1_fullText": "Your replicator is a programmable universal catalyst combined with a 3D printer. It can force any particular chemical reaction to occur over others and deposit the result of that chemical reaction in an arbitrary arrangement. However, it cannot violate conservation of energy.\n\n  So, how much energy is required to manufacture certain things? It depends on what you're making it from.\n\n  Enthalpy\n\n  Enthalpy is a word in chemistry that means the difference in amount of energy stored by the chemical bonds in two groups of molecules. The amount of energy stored in a chemical bond is always negative, meaning energy was released when the bonds were made. When you burn something, that heat energy gets put into breaking some chemical bonds, which then allows the atoms to bond to other atoms in a way that releases more energy. This energy then makes more surrounding molecules hot enough to do the same, resulting in the substance getting hot enough to make nearby air glow (fire).\n\n  Things in general tend to want to release energy more than they want to gain it. This is why hot things start to glow when they get really hot (like metal or the sun) and why things tend to fall down instead of floating in the air.\n\n  Calculating enthalpy\n\n  In order to work out the difference in enthalpy, you must first find some chemical bond diagrams, like this one for methane:\n\n  Methane has four C\u2013H bonds. O\u2082 has one O=O bond, CO\u2082 has two C=O bonds and H\u2082O has two O\u2013H bonds. Now that you have these, look them up in a bond energy table to work out the amount of energy stored in these bonds (remember that this will be negative!):\n\n  $$\\begin{array}{|l|l|}\\hline \\text{Bond} & \\text{Energy (kJ/mol)} \\ \\hline \\mathrm H- \\mathrm O & -459 \\ \\mathrm H- \\mathrm C & -411 \\ \\mathrm O- \\mathrm O & -142 \\ \\mathrm O= \\mathrm O & -494 \\ \\mathrm O- \\mathrm C & -358 \\ \\mathrm O= \\mathrm C & -799 \\ \\mathrm O\u2261 \\mathrm C & -1072 \\ \\hline\\end{array} $$\n\n  This gives methane a total bond energy of 4 \u00d7 \u2212411 kJ/mol = \u2212<PHONE_NUMBER> kJ/mol. O\u2082 has \u2212494 kJ/mol, CO\u2082 has \u22121598 kJ/mol and H\u2082O has \u2212918 kJ/mol.\n\n  Balancing the equation\n\n  Now that you have the energy per mol, you must work out how much of each molecule you need to make one mol of methane. This reaction tends to go one way (methane is burned) so I'll write it that way as according to convention.\n\n  First, write the unbalanced equation:\n\n  $$ \\mathrm{CH_4} + \\mathrm{O_2} \u2192 \\mathrm{CO_2} + \\mathrm{H_2O} $$\n\n  Now, count the number of each atom on both sides. On the left we have one C, four H and two O. On the right we have one C (check!), two O (oh dear), two H (this isn't good) and another O (making three in total).\n\n  We have the right number of C, which suggests that we don\u2019t need to change the number of anything with a C in it. H is only in one molecule that we don\u2019t know the number of, so let\u2019s add some more of that to get the right number.\n\n  $$ \\mathrm{CH_4} + \\mathrm{O_2} \u2192 \\mathrm{CO_2} + 2 \\mathrm{H_2O} $$\n\n  Now we have the same number of H and C on both sides. On the right hand side we have 4 O, and on the left hand side we have...\n\n  $$ \\mathrm{CH_4} + 2 \\mathrm{O_2} \u2192 \\mathrm{CO_2} + 2 \\mathrm{H_2O} $$\n\n  Yay!

I am 99% sure it was english language and most probably US-made.\n\n  From what I remember the best, the cover featured the main couple of heroes on the front and in the back there was a smaller image of a bipedal, large walker-robot - it stuck in my mind, because the 8 or 9 year old me chose this VHS at a local rental just because of this walker-robot.

Cricut Machine/Cutting Machine/Laser Engraver (optional)\n\n    This can be created entirely out of cardboard or any other thicker material.\n\n  Step 1: Design Your Lantern\n\n    Using a 3D modeling software such as Autodesk Inventor or Fusion to design your lantern.\n\n    Start a Sketch and create a 4\" X 5\" rectangle. This is the max size of the lantern and the design should fit inside this rectangle.\n\n    When designing your lantern be sure to have thick connection pieces between cutouts to ensure no breaking points so it remains as a single piece. Also, be sure there is a thick border around the edges.\n\n    To see how your lantern is going to look, extrude your idea by a small amount (.25\")\n\n    Time can be taken to assemble the idea with a base and top.\n\n  Step 2: Exporting the Idea\n\n    When the design is finished - place your design in a working drawing. Be sure to the scale is 1:1. Delete all borders and title blocks.\n\n    I used a Cricut Maker with knife blade to cut out the 4 sides for each students design. To do this we used Autodesk Inventor to design then placed our idea on a working drawing (.idw). Drawing paper size should be : size A (8.5\" X 11\")\n\n    Be sure to the scale is 1:1. Delete all borders and title blocks\n\n    Export as a JPG to use in the Cricit Maker Design Software. Within the Circuit Software you will have to upload the image, make the background transparent before adding it to a new project. When uploading to a new project the size didn't always transfer well, you will need to resize 4\" X 5\" rectangle.\n\n    If you don't have a Cricuit Maker - students could print their idea 1:1 on regular paper and use it as a template to cut out by hand on any thick type of paper (cardboard, foam core board, mat board ect)\n\n  Step 3: Making the Paper Circuit\n\n    Cut out a base (size 5\" x 6\") for the lantern using foam core board.\n\n    Using copper conductive tape, two: 300 ohm resisters, two LED's create a parallel circuit like the above picture.\n\n    Be sure you have copper tape extending out past the lantern for the battery.\n\n    IMPORTANT: LED's have polarity meaning direction. The longer peg is the anode side (positive). Using the longer peg wrap one side of the resistor to the LED. (See picture)\n\n    Helpful hints:\n\n    Be sure the copper tape does not go under the LED or Resistor. Electricity takes the path of least resistance and will not go through the resistor or the LED if the copper tape is under each component.\n\n    Since LED's have direction the battery will also only work in one particular direction. Flip the battery around if the LED don't light.\n\n    Adding more tape and pushing down to make sure there is a good connection help.\n\n    Test your circuit when complete\n\n    ** LED photo taken from http://www.blocksignalling.co.uk/\n\n  Step 4: Assemble the Lantern Sides\n\n    Cut vellum paper to fit to the side of the lantern. Using regular white glue, adhere the vellum to one side of each piece. The vellum helps capture the light, making it more visible and vibrant.\n\n    After the glue has set, use hot glue to adhere all the lantern sides together.\n\n  Step 5: Finishing Touches\n\n    Glue the lantern to the base that has your circuit.", "a3_documentID": "1e6bdfc0-6d1e-5696-96ee-649b4fc59d51", "a3_authorID": "57618149-fac1-01dc-aa11-ed1a86519fe2", "a3_style": "", "overall_exp": "", "model_pred": ""}}, {"data": {"Q_fullText": "<PERSON>, obsessed with the Titanic and the \"Heart of the Ocean\", has been searching for the diamond for three years and the time and money for his expedition were running out, so he clearly is in a difficult position.

It is dimensionless if the numeric value has direct meaning in the equations.\n\n  Distance is dimensional. Whether you use meters, feet or astronomical units, the relations with them stay the same, except related units, e.g. velocity, scale along with it. But angle is dimensionless. The value in radians is a ratio of lengths and if you use degrees instead, a conversion factor pops up in the relations. And bit is also dimensionless, being the 1 of information entropy, defined in terms of counts and probabilities.\n\n  Now the dimensional quantities are still related to each other. Since velocity is distance per time, if you scale the distance unit, the velocity unit scales with it.\n\n  The base units are a set that can be scaled independently of each other (in your problem domain!). Note that the choice is somewhat arbitrary. For example electric current was selected as base dimension, but electric charge would arguably make more sense. The other units are derived.\n\n  The problem domain is actually important. It turns out plenty of constants are actually just conversion factors due to choice of scaling. For example once special relativity gets involved, time becomes just another spatial dimension, distances can be measured in seconds, and velocity becomes a dimensionless ratio.\n\n  In fact, all the dimensional constants ones are and the natural units, especially in the planck variant, leave you with no dimensions at all and only the three dimensionless constants $\\pi$, $\\alpha$ and $\\alpha_G$.\n\n  On the other hand, there are cases where you can distinguish, say, parallel distance and perpendicular distance and then suddenly angle becomes perpendicular distance over parallel distance and is dimensional.

Here is an excerpt of the book:\n\n  Let us now illustrate the energy principle with a more complicated problem, the screw jack shown in Fig. 4\u20135. A handle $20$ inches long is used to turn the screw, which has $10$ threads to the inch. We would like to know how much force would be needed at the handle to lift one ton ($2000$ pounds). If we want to lift the ton one inch, say, then we must turn the handle around ten times. When it goes around once it goes approximately $126$ inches. The handle must thus travel $1260$ inches, and if we used various pulleys, etc., we would be lifting our one ton with an unknown smaller weight $W$ applied to the end of the handle. So we find out that W is about $1.6$ pounds. This is a result of the conservation of energy.\n\n  If you divide $2000$ pounds by $1260$ in you get $\\frac{100}{63}$, which is $1.58$, a number close enough to $1.6$ pounds, which according to <PERSON> is the weight that we need to apply to the end of the handle. I believe, however, that this calculation is wrong given a dimensional analysis of such operation.\n\n  Here is my dimensional analysis:\n\n  $\\frac{2000 pounds * 1 in}{ 1260 inches }$ = $\\frac{[M] * [L] }{[L]}$ = ${[M]}$ And this is wrong, as we are suppose to get a force, not a mass.\n\n  I found this website, where you can find what I think is an email from an student reporting the teacher that he believes he got the number diving $\\frac{5}{\\pi}$ .

Video screencap from www.tmsuk.co.jp/rodem/\n\n  I love technology. I suppose I am what we might call in in Japan a \u2018gijutsu otaku,\u2019 (\u6280\u8853\u30aa\u30bf\u30af) a person with an excessive love of technology. Maybe this comes from growing up in an era when there were still mainframes, and personal computers (PC) could at best only handle word processing or games with really bad graphics. I am also disabled, so technology is a necessity for me as well. The PC and the smartphone are now indispensable features of my everyday life, but there are also assistive devices that are both functional and cool, and robotics is an area I follow with keen interest. Driverless cars, certainly, cannot come soon enough for me.\n\n  Yet sometimes I am hesitant about particular technological developments, as technological ambition can sometimes surpass concerns about functionality. Take, for example, the recent innovation from Tmsuk Co. Ltd, a company based in Munakata City, Fukuoka Prefecture, that in mid-December 2017 produced a new type of robotic wheelchair called the \u2018Rodem\u2019. The Rodem is allegedly designed to allow the user to transfer from wheelchair to bed more easily than the longstanding \u2018chair design\u2019 wheelchair.\n\n  As \u2018Nikkei Technology\u2019 reported:\n\n  \u201cThe robot, \u201cRodem,\u201d was developed so that the user can easily ride on the wheelchair from a bed, sofa, etc. At the time of getting on/off the robot, its seat protrudes backward and diagonally downward, and the user straddles the seat from behind. There is no backrest, but the user can lean forward to put his/her weight on the front part of the seat\u2026The robot can be charged by using a 100V domestic power source. After being charged for eight hours, it can travel 15km or more. Its maximum speed is 6km/h.\u201d\n\n  The device can be controlled by smartphone, allowing users to control it remotely, to bring it closer or move it further away from a bed, for example.\n\n  It's the apparent convenience and comfort that makes the \u2018Rodem\u2019 so appealing, of course. To be able to get in and out bed easily without the need for a carer, and with such a cool-looking wheelchair, that must be a good thing, right? \u201cWhile conventional wheelchairs give a hug, the Rodem gives a piggyback,\u201d said Tmsuk\u2019s President <PERSON>, suggesting that he certainly thinks so.\n\n  A spokesperson for the Tmsuk Company also stated in an article in The Daily Mail that the Rodem was intended to \u201c\u2026break down the barriers facing elderly and disabled people,\u201d by allowing for \u201cmovement to widen the users\u2019 living area and increase their quality of life.\u201d\n\n  A desire to break down barriers and increase the quality of life of disabled people is, of course, a good thing. Yet some in the disability community have doubts about the Rodem.\n\n  UK-based Access and Inclusion expert and wheelchair user <PERSON> tweeted that he was fed up with \u201c. . . ego driven product designers telling us what we need & creating answers to problems Disabled people don't have. This won't advance accessible tech but looks good in media.\u201d\n\n  <PERSON> was equally outspoken in a conversation with me via Twitter private message. \u201cTmsuk Rodem chair proves designers have no idea about wheelchairs & their users,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026the bizarre concept around transferring into it indicates that very few chair users took part in the design process at all. To transfer onto the Tmsuk Rodem is much harder than the usual side transfer and there is much less support with the loss of the backrest. It works for almost no wheelchair users.\u201d\n\n  If its purpose is to help the majority of wheelchair users, said <PERSON>, the Tmsuk Rodem wheelchair is simply not up to scratch. But to the media and public at large, it looks like a great idea. As an article on the tech site Engadget gushed in December 2017, \u201cThe robotic wheelchair gives you a piggyback ride that not only makes it easier to climb aboard, but puts you in a high, forward-mounted position. It's easier to brush your teeth, make breakfast or just hold face-to-face conversations.\u201d\n\n  I am also moved to speculate about the reasons behind Japan\u2019s interest in robotics, which might include the scarcity of staff for certain jobs.", "a0_documentID": "541fdf60-ec0b-5d3f-b5e9-6fc58085b3a8", "a0_authorID": "65cffa66-ca8a-a9dc-6d5c-cfc9551bee78", "a0_style": "", "a1_fullText": "How do the strategic assumptions and goals of a space force affect the capabilities of the space force?\n\nSo, to start the question, I want to have a small assumption here:\n\n  Let us assume that we are an interplanetary civilisation. We have spammed much of the Solar System, but it is not all sunshine and flowers (if it was, I would not be asking this question). According to Atomic Rockets, the first two steps for a Space Force are strategic assumptions and goals, which I will provide an example for very soon. But first some more context on the assumptions for this situation.\n\n  You have a growing insurrection on Mars, the Belt, the Galilean Moons and the Saturn Moon System, with Mars having a population more than 700 million, the <PERSON> having 160 total colonies, which combined make up a population of 40 million, while the combined Outer Solar System populations are basically around 100 million.\n\n  Now, the problem is......those 840 million colonists are NOT wanting to stick with the 12.9 billion people on Earth, mainly due to growing secessionist sentiment, Earth getting desperate for phosphorus deposits on Mars, Deimos and other C-type asteroids, which are controlled by various large corporations, whom also dominate other industries, in addition to the mining of phosphorus, a growing cultural divide, and failed negotiations between the UN, its member states and autonomists.\n\n  We also have a combined threat of \"pirates\" in Cislunar Space, Martian orbital space and the Trojans, which also host a lot of black market activity and is often a terrorist haven.\n\n  And finally, we have the problem of spacecraft permits, since civilians can now get their own spacecraft, albeit with some degree of expense, not to mention bureaucracy.\n\n  This gives the UN's space forces four key priorities:\n\n   1. Protect commerce to keep the phosphorus flowing to Earth.\n   2. Enforce the laws and regulations of the UN's member states and UN treaties on international law.\n   3. Ensure that asteroids are not able to smash Earth.\n   4. Power Projection to crush any potential uprisings.\n\n  Another thing I should point out is that most UN space force assets are contributions from UN member states, with it only being mandatory in the event of an emergency (such as the ongoing uprising), while the UN itself keeps a small directly controlled cluster, and three Espatier divisions (Espatiers are basically space marines) to deal with goals 2 and 3 (at least for now).\n\n  To be clear, the UN's member states of the planet with settlements and thus, space forces by order of interplanetary influence are:\n\n   1. United States\n   2. China\n   3. European Union (mainly British, French, German and Italian, with the ocassional settlement by other EU member states)\n   4. Japan\n   5. Korea\n   6. India\n   7. Russia\n   8. Israel\n   9. The Gulf States (under the Islamic Space Alliance, led by Saudi Arabia)\n  10. Latin America (under the Pan American Space Organisation, led by Brazil)\n  11. ASEAN (led by Indonesia)\n  12. Nigeria\n  13. South Africa\n\n  These nations and space alliances all have space forces, and can enforce laws and regulations within the colonies, so long as they comply with international treaties, even though the UN member states have fought armed conflicts against each other in space via proxy prior to 2367, but since then, the UN has been more influential.\n\n  As for the UN member states, I should point out that although they all have national interests at heart, they do agree that independence for the colonies in a total sense could spell disaster, especially the Big 5 (previously, the Big 6), even though they also have autonomist sympathisers, though mainly moderate autonomists. This proved to be a factor in failed negotiations with the autonomists, which in turn, led to hostilities becoming more official as secessioonists became more and more radicalised. However, since we are focusing on both the unofficial and official state of hostilities, we need to account for the autonomists playing a role.\n\n  Given that, will the capabilities of the UN space force be efficient in performing the specified goals, especially with the basis of its assumptions (both in terms of security and fiscal environments), especially goals 1 and 4, as the undeclared war becomes less and less undeclared and more official? More importantly, how can it operate efficiently under its security concerns and fiscal restraints?", "a1_documentID": "440ad305-24ca-54c4-ac6b-0b10034e7cd7", "a1_authorID": "5c283426-ed9b-5dd2-1c3a-8f141aa5d18d", "a1_style": "", "a2_fullText": "As someone has said in another answer, accuracy is less important in fiction than story itself. What matters is to convey sufficient meaning to move your story forward, and to do so in a way that will be understood by your readers.\n\n  On this basis, I think you have several options:\n\n   1. If using the correct terms doesn't serve the story, consider ignoring them. The purpose of dialogue is to serve the story, whether that's expressing character, relationships, describing setting or whatever. If something doesn't serve the story, omit it.\n\n   2. At the other extreme, use the correct terms from the original language. Explain them the first time they're used, or use them in a context where their meaning becomes apparent to the reader. Transliterate rather than using the non-Latin alphabet.\n\n   3. Use roughly equivalent English. \"Hiya, older-brother-as-a-female-speaker!\" doesn't good in English, but \"Hi, Big Brother\" sounds fine.\n\n   4. Invent a convention. For example, female siblings could always call their youngest sibling \"<PERSON>\", but call older siblings, \"Sister\". An older female relative could be \"Aunt\", a younger \"Aunty\".\n\n   5. Research the way that people from (say) Korea actually handle this problem when they are referring to family members when they speak English, and simply follow suit.\n\n   6. If you need to, explain the relationship when new characters are introduced, and explain the associated obligations to the reader. Of course, this wouldn't be required if the reader is from the culture that you intend to depict, because they're introduced to the rules a child. But, if your intended audience is from another culture, you need to help them out. After all, your first duty is to your readers, not to your subject matter.\n\n   7. If the reason you want to use the titles is for one character to show respect to another, find another way to convey that respect. For example, a younger family member may offer their seat to someone older, or offer to carry something for them.\n\n  It may be appropriate to mix and match these strategies, but each character needs to be consistent in the way s/he expresses herself.

Especially since I couldn't identify the plant from the photo. But let's look at different options (just, scratch the surface of a very large topic).\n\n  First, why are the plants green? It is common knowledge that the photosynthetic pigment, chlorophyll, gives this color to leaves. This substance has maximum absorption in the red and blue parts of the spectrum, so the spectrum of light transmitted and reflected from the leaf is dominated by the green part of the spectrum.\n\n  Direction 1.\n\n  It should be remembered that chlorophyll is far from being the only pigment found in leaves. For example, carotenoids - which give yellow and reddish colors - are present in plant leaves. There are many carotenoids (according to Wikipedia there are over 1100 known, but that number will continue to grow). The biological role is also varied. But in the course of the question, we may be interested, for example, in the photoprotective role of carotenoids. They are involved in the deactivation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS can be formed during photosynthesis and can potentially be harmful to cells. Therefore, in conditions of excess solar radiation, plants can increase concentrations of carotenoids to prevent oxidative stress. It has already been pointed out to you in the comments that younger leaves look yellow - this is a common occurrence. The leaf is a very expensive organ, in the sense that the plant invests a lot of plastic substances in its development. So it makes sense that young, growing leaves get extra protection. That is, a young leaf that has not yet formed all the necessary structures (thick enough cuticle, efficient conductive system, etc.) is less efficient in terms of photosynthesis and therefore more susceptible to negative processes of photodamage. Increased concentrations of carotenoids, among other things, can reduce such risks. If you add to this the small thickness, it is understandable why young leaves often look more yellow.\n\n  Direction 2.\n\n  I have already said that leaves are expensive organs. They have a high protein content, which is very valuable to the plant. If a leaf is damaged or aged, there is a threat of irreversible loss of protein, which would be a great waste. Therefore, in such cases, plants trigger complex processes of removing valuable substances from the leaves. In particular, chlorophyll begins to break down, and the decomposition products are transported to the more durable parts of the plant. This is the reason why leaves change color in the fall, before defoliation. When the concentration of chlorophyll decreases, other pigments, such as the same carotenoids, increasingly affect leaf color. That's why damaged and old leaves often turn yellowish. Although, I doubt that in the case of your plant, this process is the cause of the yellow leaves.\n\n  Direction 3.\n\n  Again about photodamage. We have to remember that the capture of photons by chlorophyll is only the beginning of a very long chain of chemical transformations needed for photosynthesis to take place. If the plant is under unfavorable conditions (low or high temperature, lack of moisture, etc.), the biochemical cycles can be disrupted. In this case, chlorophyll will continue to absorb photons and enter the excited state, but it will not be able to release this energy further into the cycle, for example due to depletion of the plastoquinone pool. Under such conditions, the threat of heat shock (if the captured energy is released as heat) or oxidative shock through the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) increases. To prevent such adverse effects, some plants have developed interesting mechanisms. In particular, mottled leaf coloration, where green areas alternate with meteolated (chlorophyll-free) areas. Such meteolated areas act as a kind of buffer storage of substances which can be used when the resources of green areas are exhausted (I am speaking here in a very simplified manner; in fact, these mechanisms are quite complicated and it is not quite correct to describe them simply as storage of substances). What is important to answer the question is that some plants can purposely form areas of tissue without chlorophyll, including yellowish coloration. In general, the leaf may look \"more yellow.\"\n\n  Direction 4.\n\n  Before that, we were talking about chemistry. But leaf color is also influenced by anatomical structure. The evolution of the leaf was aimed at maximizing its efficiency as an organ of light capturing and transformation. For example, in the structure of a typical leaf of a broad-leaved plant, we can distinguish (conditionally) 4 basic layers of tissues: upper epidermis, columnar tissue, spongy tissue, lower epidermis. All these histological layers contain cells of different shapes. When light passes through the cells, it refracts, that is, each cell acts as an optical lens.", "a3_documentID": "a93a5676-0e06-5388-92a8-38c2d7ee8e5b", "a3_authorID": "877be78d-adf8-7685-66cc-a2c7e35f796f", "a3_style": "", "overall_exp": "", "model_pred": ""}}, {"data": {"Q_fullText": "It can be easily proved. But for almost every easy prove, there is some abstraction involved.\n\n  Luckily, I think I can offer some insight. Modern physics is very related to differential geometry and the main idea is that pure geometrical objects should have definitions which are independent of coordinates. Unfortunately, I don't have space and time to explain what is a proper geometrical object here, so the previous phrase will work as a definition.\n\n  That said, if you can define the $F_{\\alpha \\beta}$ without ever mentioning coordinates, you will know automatically that it is independent of which coordinates you choose.\n\n  The twist is that $F_{\\alpha \\beta}$ is not invariant as you pointed out, but the quantity $F = F_{\\alpha \\beta} dx^{\\alpha} \\wedge dx^{\\beta}$ is. So, if you could define $F$ before $F_{\\alpha \\beta}$, you would automatically know how this field strength tensor transforms from the requirement of $F$ being geometric. This is possible, but I cannot do it here. It is done, however, in every differential geometry book.\n\n  Let me explain a bit the notation.\n\n  $\\bullet$ The quantity $F$ that I wrote is called 2-form;\n\n  $\\bullet$ The symbol $\\wedge$ is usually known as exterior product. It is there so that we can remember the antisymmetry:\n\n  $$ d x^{\\alpha} \\wedge d x^{\\beta} = - d x^{\\beta} \\wedge d x^{\\alpha}; $$\n\n  $\\bullet$ The $dx^{\\alpha}$ are known as basis $1$-forms. They are a basis for an abstract linear space usually known as cotangent space of a surface. This much you should not bother at the moment. The important thing is that you can sum and multiply them by scalars.\n\n  Under an arbitrary differentiable change of coordinates $x' \\mapsto x$, the $1$-forms change to\n\n  $$ dx^{\\alpha \\, '} = \\frac{\\partial x^{\\alpha \\, '}}{\\partial x^{\\beta}} d x^{\\beta}$$\n\n  and you can prove with the transformations you wrote (and I really leave this to you) that\n\n  $$ F'{\\mu \\nu} (x') \\, d x^{\\mu \\, '} \\wedge d x^{\\nu \\, '} = F{\\alpha \\beta} (x)\\, d x^{\\alpha} \\wedge d x^{\\beta} .$$\n\n  Thus, $F$ looks the same under any change of coordinates. It is therefore independent of which coordinates you choose and geometrical quantity.\n\n  Here, I reversed engineered the logic just so you can see how it works. The direct way to prove what you want is to define first $F$ and then work out $F_{\\alpha \\beta}$.\n\n  As a final comment, notice that two <PERSON>'s equations can be written in a manifestly invariant way under differentiable change of coordinates. They are known as <PERSON> identities:\n\n  $$ \\partial_{[\\mu} F_{\\nu \\sigma]} = 0 \\Leftrightarrow d F = 0. $$\n\n  The other two cannot be written in this way because they involve the metric, or more precisely, the <PERSON> dual. I should emphasize that diffeomorphic invariant things have geometrical significance and then you would know how their components transform.

Allow me to do another problem, which is faster to type.\n\n  Warning : I am ignoring factors of i, $\\frac{1}{2}$, etc. Just follow the logic.\n\n  Consider the theory with $H_{\\text{int}} = \\lambda \\int d^{3}x \\, \\phi^{4}(x)$ and let us calculate the 2-point function to first order in $\\lambda$:\n\n  $$ \\langle 0 | T \\phi(x) \\phi(y) \\int dt \\, H_{\\text{int}} | 0 \\rangle $$\n\n  Let us write it as follows\n\n  $$ \\langle 0 | T \\phi(x) \\phi(y) \\int d^{4} z \\,\\, \\phi(z)\\,\\phi(z)\\,\\phi(z)\\,\\phi(z) | 0 \\rangle. $$\n\n  <PERSON>'s theorem states that only full contractions survive. This means that there must not remain a single $\\phi(x)$ floating around. In this example, there are two independent <PERSON> contractions:\n\n    * Contract $\\phi(x)$ with $\\phi(y)$ and $\\phi(z)$'s between themselves;\n\n    * or contract $\\phi(x)$ with $\\phi(z)$, $\\phi(y)$ with $\\phi(z)$ and $\\phi(z)$ with $\\phi(z)$.\n\n  The first contraction can be done in three ways. Since the $x$ and $y$ contraction is fixed, you just have to choose a partner for $\\phi(z)$, and there are $3$ of them. The second contraction can be done in 12 ways. There are 4 choices to contract $\\phi(x)$ with $\\phi(z)$ and then $3$ choices remain when you contract $\\phi(y)$ with $\\phi(z)$.\n\n  The result is then\n\n  $$ \\langle 0 | T \\phi(x) \\phi(y) \\int d^{4} z \\,\\, \\phi(z)\\,\\phi(z)\\,\\phi(z)\\,\\phi(z) | 0 \\rangle = 3 \\lambda \\Delta(x-y) \\int d^{4} z \\, \\Delta (z-z) \\, \\Delta(z-z) \\ + 12 \\lambda \\int d^{4} z \\, \\Delta(x-z) \\, \\Delta(y-z) \\Delta(z-z). $$\n\n  You could now work at order $\\lambda^{2}$:\n\n  $$ \\langle 0 | T \\phi(x) \\phi(y) \\int d^{4} z \\,\\, \\phi(z)\\,\\phi(z)\\,\\phi(z)\\,\\phi(z) \\int d^{4} u \\,\\, \\phi(u)\\,\\phi(u)\\,\\phi(u)\\,\\phi(u)| 0 \\rangle. $$\n\n  But it is quickly recognizable how this is going to be a pain in the butt. A way around is to use <PERSON> diagrams.\n\n  In a diagram, a contraction is represented by a line and the $H_{\\text{int}}$ becomes what is known as a vertex. You can see how it is a vertex, because it is precisely in the interacting Hamiltonian where the non-linearities are. So all contractions with the terms inside the Hamiltonian will give raise to vertices of the diagram.\n\n  I would draw the diagram for the example that I just did, but I do not know how to do this in here.

And given that I experienced a few encounters myself in my adventures, camping in the woods seems unsafe and is no longer an option for me. At least not when I go by myself or in small groups. And since the bears won\u2019t be going anywhere any time soon and I still want to enjoy camping, rock climbing and mountaineering, I have to be creative. A hard metal box seems like a safer place to spend the night in than in a tent.\n\n    And as much as I wish that I had a comfortable camper or at least a small van, I decided to give car camping a try and do the best I can with what I have. And what I have is this Mercedes_Benz A Class from 1998.\n\n    Turns out Mercedes had a few more tricks up their sleeves when they designed this brilliant car.

Remember: what you are seeing now it\u2019s only improvising or prototyping. It\u2019s a proof of concept that can be refined in the future. So no criticism ok? What I came up with is a piece of black material mounted on the metal frame of each door with GEOMAG magnets. GEOMAG is a magnetic construction game based on two main pieces: a metallic ball and a rubber bar with a magnet on each side. You can easily buy this game from amazon or ebay or maybe your local toy store. I will add a link or two in the description if you don\u2019t know what I am talking about. The best thing about geomag is the rubber around the magnets that prevent any metal parts from being scratched.\n    I didn\u2019t hand pick the material for this project, it is something I had around the house. I think it is used in tapestry for covering the frame under the sofas. I cut the material with scissors to fit the frame of each window and that was it. The black material is very thin and it allows me to see from the inside out but blocks the visibility from the outside which is exactly what I want. Everything is easy and fast to mount and unmount and it takes very little space when not being used. Also it allows me to open the windows for fresh air without getting any mosquitos inside the car. The windshield and back window don\u2019t have any metal frames so I can\u2019t rely on the same method for covering those up.

It can always bring an aspect of awe and mystery to the world, as well as an additional complexity. When creating a world with an interactive deity, it can be challenging to decide or imagine how they are portrayed and interact with humans and other mortals. In most imaginary worlds, deities are always omnipotent beings, who use power over mortals. They are always revered and worshiped by people who inhabit the world and their actions can be a profound effect on the course of history. In some instances, deities may be aloof and distant, watching over the world from a distance, and intervening only when absolutely necessary. In other cases, they may appear to be more active, appearing directly to mortals and taking active roles in their lives.\n\n  When creating an interactive deity in your imaginary world, the first step is to decide how they will interact with mortals. Deities always take numerous forms from an awe-inspiring and powerful godlike figure to a more subtle and less obvious presence. The deity could be powerful force that is feared and worshipped by its people, or it could be a more subtle force that only revealed to a select few depending on the type of the world being created. In addition, deity could interact with mortals through direct communication like prophetic visions or warnings, or through indirect means like manipulating events and guiding people. Depending on whether the mortal is a believer or non-believer, the deity could also have different interaction level. For instance, a non-believer may experience just subtle clues and hints from the deity while the believer may receive direct communication.\n\n  Besides, the deity should be portrayed in a manner that is true to their character. This can be achieved through literature, art, or other forms of expression. A deity that is feared may be depicted as an intimidating and powerful figure, while a deity that is mysterious or more subtle may be depicted as more mysterious or enigmatic.", "a2_documentID": "80114a95-c300-50df-af37-97ea5d256eda", "a2_authorID": "6aef7aae-d4b2-b938-a294-d1dec89f9132", "a2_style": "", "a3_fullText": "There are a fair few vectors missing from your question which could vastly change the direction of this answer, so I am making a few assumptions:\n\n    * They will be fairly rare, and therefore have little to no no pack mentality. Pack tactics of two or more of these monsters would wildly differ from solo encounters.\n\n    * High aggression, always attack when encountering humans. Also tend to wander as they please (this is to ensure encounters happen).\n\n    * Just because someone plays football or is a jock, it doesn't mean they have a certain intelligence. But from the way this question is worded I'll assume slightly below average human intelligence, as often depicted commonly in college movies.\n\n  Speed\n\n  Their speed is the most limiting factor to this creature. With a top speed of 1kmh or 0.63 mph, they are extremely slow. With the average human walking speed being roughly 5kmh or 4mph, anyone could walk away from seeing one of these creatures at a more than leisurely pace. With their maximum range being 6 foot or 1.8 meters, one would have to be very unfortunate to get caught within range of this creature. The only real danger would be if they would be nocturnal and catch people camping outside, or if they were to wander into densely populated urban areas like markets. And even then, after the first one or two victims, the rest would be out of range in no time. When you spot one on the wild (they are very easy to spot at range, as they are blue), all you'd have to do is go around it in a wide arc and mind your business. All in all, with this speed I doubt they will be a credible threat to anyone not directly trying to attack it.\n\n  CRD\n\n  Which brings us to the requested capacity to resist dying. Say one of these does show up in a town, and eats one or two town folk, its safe to say the rest would like to get rid of it. Here is we're the trouble starts, as it is ridiculously resistant to any kind of medieval weaponry, and smart enough to avoid most low effort traps. Of course, due to their speed a town could take hours of not days to prepare for a fight, as keeping anyone away from it would be fairly easy to do. This makes traps like pitfalls efficient, if you disguise it properly and can bait the monster. Once caught, you can take your leisure time finding a way to kill the thing, or simply wait for it to starve.\n\n  I would imagine the most effective counter for this monster would be fire. Simply douse it in flammable liquid and set it ablaze. Impervious or not, it will take a tremendous amount of damage. My preferred attack would be to catch it with a fishing net covered in any kind of oil, or to catch it in a pitfall with coal and firewood on the bottom.\n\n  conclusion\n\n  These monsters are massively let down by their speed and range. I doubt it would be a threat to anyone they don't immediately get the drop on, or is stupid enough to attack them with a less than ten foot pole. If anyone did get too close, this would mean near instant death by clobbering or gobbling, but again, it would be really easy not to get close. Given human psychology, if one were spotted in the wild they would alert the nearest town, who would likely make a spectacle out of killing the thing.

Photo used with his permission.\n\n  Away from the media's spotlight in Yemen, the country\u2019s Christian minority is struggling to survive amidst an increase in targeted attacks.\n\n  Religious facilities have been destroyed. In 2015, there were three attacks on Christian institutions in the southern port city of Aden, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\n  In 2016, also in Aden, an Indian priest was kidnapped and tortured during an attack on a Missionaries of Charity home during which four nuns were killed. The gunmen, presumably with the Islamic State (ISIS), wrote on the walls: \u2018\u201cThere is no God, but God. <PERSON> is the messenger of God. The Islamic State. <PERSON>\u2019s curse on Christians and Jews.\u201d\n\n  Due to these difficult conditions, many Christians in Yemen have been reduced to practicing their religion underground.\n\n  \u2018<PERSON>\u2019 (an alias) is in his late twenties. He became an atheist for a few months before converting to Christianity three years ago. He believes that this has put his life at risk on a daily basis.\n\n  He is part of an estimated 41,000 Yemeni Christians in the country, although he believes the number to be higher at approximately 70,000. He describes the religious risks he faces amidst the country's ongoing conflict:\n\n  It would cost them less than a dollar to kill me. It may happen at any time. They killed my friends; can you imagine what it\u2019s like getting killed for praying? For being peaceful? You think it is scary? My friends were not afraid. I may die at any time but I am not afraid. The Lord is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer.\n\n  Christians in Yemen experience persecution for their faith. Leaving Islam is seen as a betrayal by many and may be punishable by death. Hence, they keep their faith hidden. They may not even tell their parents:\n\n  Many [Yemeni] had to flee but many are converting and getting baptized. Christianity in Yemen is growing despite the risks we have to face. They are seeing the truth in the bible, there\u2019s some sort of spiritual catharsis they feel. And the violence they\u2019re facing is making them seek peace. They found peace in the bible.\n\n  Those who do find a Christian community often pray in empty apartments and delete their chats online:\n\n  We keep on changing our location. We don\u2019t want them to notice our regular meetings underground. Christians in Yemen dream of praying in a church. Christian women dream of wearing a necklace with a cross. I want to get the cross tattooed on my chest. It is an act of revolt that my soul needs. But I am aware it is a suicidal act. I can\u2019t even like posts about Christianity on social media.\n\n  He confirms that he is not afraid of death but afraid of leaving his community:\n\n  Death doesn\u2019t scare me, but leaving Christians who need me does. They need my support, I have a mission here.\n\n  <PERSON> believes actions speak louder than words, and his actions got him arrested in Sana'a, where he is based. In 2017, he dressed up as <PERSON> on Christmas and gave kids toys and food. Houthis arrested him and tortured him for days.\n\n  They humiliated me. They beat me nonstop for 4 days. When I convinced them that I am not Christian, that I was just helping kids; they let me go.\n\n  The pro-government forces are based in the southern port city of Aden while Houthis control key central provinces in the north, including Yemen's capital, Sana'a. Al-Qaeda and ISIS have also spread as a result of the multifaceted regional, local, and international power struggles.\n\n  Despite the torture, <PERSON> has no regrets. He believes that Christians have become doubly vulnerable during the conflict between Houthi rebels and Yemeni government forces supported by a Saudi-led coalition.\n\n  We need help, I don\u2019t know how or who should help us. We\u2019re dealing with militias, not a government, which makes it harder for us to find a solution. I am glad you\u2019re helping me get my voice heard; I\u2019m tired of living in the shadows.

Ignore most of that and give this a try even if it comes out crappy. This is a low investment way to observe a lost art and to observe some things for yourself which are shrouded in mystery for most of us.\n\n    However, take my safety precautions very seriously, and any of the additional precautions that people might add in the comments. You probably want to go out and read some more safety information as well because this really is serious stuff.\n\n    What I intend to show you here is that you can rather simply and easily turn your aluminum cans into nice clean metal muffins ingots that can be used for casting projects later, or you can just end up with some cool metal muffins paperweights and move on to another hobby.\n\n    If you haven't done this before, you are going to be amazed at how many cans it takes to get a small amount of aluminum.\n\n  Supplies\n\n      * A shload of aluminum cans.\n      * Brick, preferably firebrick\n      * Hair dryer or small electric PC fan\n      * ~2 in metal tubing\n      * Charcoal\n      * Appropriately sized crucible (the one in the pictures is a #3 4KG one from amazon)\n      * Proper tongs for your crucible\n      * Proper PPE for high temps\n\n  Step 1: Stack the Brick\n\n    This step can't be specified to closely since it depends a lot on the size and shape of your crucible. But here is the general process:\n\n     1. Stack one or two layers of firebrick on top of another fireproof surface. Be careful, spalling can occur with concrete. The experts say that for safety your entire work area should be a bed of sand.\n     2. Stack a one layer square of bricks around your crucible, making sure that you have a little space on all sides. You should probably test and see that you will have room to reach in with your tongs and pick up the crucible.\n     3. Adjust and fiddle.\n     4. Start a second layer, but somewhere in this layer you want a gap that is just about the right size to fit your pipe that will be connected to some kind of blower. Don't try to use a hair dryer to directly stoke your fire; hair dryers melt! I generally use a pipe and connect the hair dryer to that, giving it distance from the heat.\n     5. Stack further layers up until you get to a layer that goes just above the top of the crucible. If you don't make it high enough you might have trouble getting things hot enough. You might even at some point want to put something over the top (with a gap of course) to encourage things to get hotter. But your 'lid' should not touch the crucible!\n\n    This stack need not be pretty. You'll probably rebuild it each time you break down cans. If you want something more permanent, you should build a proper furnace.\n\n  Step 2: Add the Crucible and a Few Cans\n\n  Step 3: Get Things Really Hot\n\n    You need to get a good and hot fire going in the furnace. For this type of furnace and for just getting started with breaking down aluminum I think most folks should start with charcoal briquettes that you'd use for grilling. Don't try coal, oil, wood or anything else for your first try.\n\n     1. I'd suggest using one of those chimney type charcoal starters and get a full chimney load of coals nice and hot.\n     2. Dump in all those coals.\n     3. Pack more briquettes, straight from the bag, all around the crucible.\n     4. Fire up whatever kind of blower it is that you are going to use.\n     5. Adjust the blower so that it really gets the fire roaring. It should literally be a roaring sound if you have it right. You will find it works best if you can get the air blowing in a bit of a circle or vortex going around the crucible. I highly recommend good personal protective equipment that covers your entire face at this point so that you don't get sparks in your eyes and hair.\n     6.", "a0_documentID": "752460e2-18a4-5d56-bb62-4c19dc620e0c", "a0_authorID": "51c4a4ac-001c-7362-2495-ce1a5860b08d", "a0_style": "", "a1_fullText": "Parabolic mirror\n\n  Easy one - take a parabolic mirror (e.g. a typical satellite dish, the one you can find in your kitchen and paint it shiny), put some heat resistant holder in the focus and there you go.\n\n  The heat in the focus can easily reach upper hundreds of kelvins (which is more than enough even for a grill) for a typical small (~1m) parabolic dish and you can regulate the temperature very easily.

Bring both ends of the longer links together so they meet and bond remembering to keep the centre line adhesive facing inwards.

A clade is a group where all members are eachothers' closest relatives compared to members outside the group. Another way to put it is that a clade exists if there is a common ancestor whose descendants include all and only members of that group.\n\n  All of today's apes share a common ancestor to the exclusion of all non-apes. The descendants of today's apes will also share that ancestor*, and so will still be within the ape clade. The terms \"ape\" and \"primate\" are best thought of as expressions of relationships rather than clusters of traits.\n\n  Could humans evolve something very non-ape-like? For argument let's say humans evolved a tail. I suppose colloquially it could become common for people to use the term \"ape\" to refer only to the tailless apes, but anyone speaking of evolutionary relationships could still use it to refer to all the descendants of today's apes. Then it would just be a matter of clarifying which meaning is intended. Since \"ape\" is a common name, it might get used more flexibly, but the scientific term for apes, Hominoidea, certainly wouldn't change.\n\n  If humans evolved a tail they wouldn't cease to be apes, because \"ape\" isn't defined as \"primates without tails,\" it really means \"all the descendants of [this one ancestor],\" which we generally recognize by their lack of tails.\n\n  The term \"fish\" is a similar example. If one calls a shark, a salmon, and a coelacanth all fish, then really humans should be included as well. Otherwise, \"fish\" stops being a biological term and just means something like \"aquatic vertebrates that have gills**.\"\n\n  I'll finally add that it's fairly common for a lost trait to re-evolve, or for a new trait evolved in an ancestor to be missing from some descendants. Often, some additional observation will show that the re-evolved trait is actually different from the lost trait (think, for example of salmon fins vs. whale fins), but not necessarily. This can make it more difficult to accurately reconstruct relationships, but doesn't exclude those organisms from their clade.\n\n  *This is ignoring the possibility of hybridization, which is extrememly unlikely for ape/non-ape, but can be common in other groups.\n\n  **Mostly", "a0_documentID": "d65e1a1d-918c-5e6f-b333-bcebeb1e6eae", "a0_authorID": "b2369efe-c1c0-5754-1ab8-8a866a9822f9", "a0_style": "", "a1_fullText": "Turn an Old Saw Blade Into a <PERSON>\n\nIntroduction: Turn an Old Saw Blade Into a <PERSON>\n\n\n    Hello fellow makers!\n\n\n\n\n    In this Instructable I would like to show you the process I used to make my very first knife using an old circular saw blade.

The flatness along the edge and its height makes it ideal for chopping, and its flat-out adorable size makes it easy to wield for cooks of all sizes.\n\n\n    I started by tracing the old saw blade onto a piece of printer paper, now that we have our size limit we can start to design our Kamagata. My design is 55mm high with a 90mm cutting edge and a 20mm thick tang.\n\n\n    Once you are happy with your design you can cut it out with some scissors and stick it onto the blade with some school glue. Now you can either trace around the design or like I did use some spray paint and spray over the design and then peel the paper off when it is dry.\n\n\n  Step 3: Cutting Out Your Knife:\n\n    Now we need to cut out our design.\n\n\n    You can use a thin reinforced metal cutting disk or a scroll saw to cut out the knife just take care as a lot of the circular saw discs have carbide around the edge that will eat away your blade very quickly.\n\n\n    After I cut it out I used a thick grinding disk to smooth out all of the edges and also round the curves.\n\n  Step 4: Getting Rid of the Rust:\n\n    Now we need to get rid of the rust that is on the surface of the blade.\n\n\n    First we will need to soak the knife in a vinegar bath before sanding.", "a1_documentID": "99863745-3200-58d6-93c3-926ed14e8573", "a1_authorID": "65b1bcff-26ea-c73c-246e-869495bef01c", "a1_style": "", "a2_fullText": "AutoCAD MacroMitt\n\nIntroduction: AutoCAD MacroMitt\n\n    In my work I use a small number of AutoCAD commands and keys repeatedly.

Whether or not we can actually build a clock with the necessary accuracy is not important for this definition as long as we can conceive of one being built.\n\n  Position can be measured arbitrarily well with measuring sticks.\n\n  Using these two quantities above we could conceive of strategically placing an array of measuring sticks and clocks (that is building a reference frame from them) so as to entirely measure the motion -- position, velocity, acceleration, etc as a function of time -- of any object we care to.\n\n  Now I turn my attention to the most important equation in Newtonian mechanics: $F=ma$ (or $F=\\dot p$ it doesn't really matter in this case). For this equation to make any physical sense we need to be able to measure the mass and/ or force (and/ or momentum) of an object during any experiment arbitrarily well.\n\n  How can we define force or mass (or momentum) in such a way that in the midst of some complicated motion -- possibly involving losing/gaining mass, etc -- we can still be certain that we can measure values for these quantities?\n\n  One note on this: I would prefer not to assume the equivalence principle as a way of measuring mass. Let's just pretend that inertia mass and gravitational mass are not the same because, as far as I can tell, in classical mechanics there is no strong reason to believe the equivalence principle holds based solely on <PERSON>'s laws (and other equally important \"first principles\" like the conservation laws). Of course, there's empirical evidence, but again let's just ignore this for now and see if we can find another way of measuring mass (or force or momentum or kinetic energy or any other thing which as allow us to obtain a measurement of mass indirectly).\n\n  EDIT: This will be a response to the question that Qmechanic links to (admittedly a similar question) detailing why I find the answers therein unsatisfactory. My hope is that either someone can give a new answer or can assuage my uneasiness about one or more of those answers to the linked question.\n\n  The top answer is by joshphysics.\n\n  The part about forces (and masses) is his statement of the third law: \" If any two objects are being observed in a local inertial frame, then their accelerations will be opposite in direction, and the ratio of their accelerations will be constant.\" Here he implicitly assumes that two objects in an inertial frame will be accelerating. So I think he just forgot to add that there must also be so interaction (force) between the two objects.\n\n  If we assume that there is an interaction between the two objects then this is just <PERSON>'s regular old third law (pretty much). However, this definition only provides a means of measuring mass if the accelerations of the two bodies are completely due to the single interaction between the two objects.\n\n  I'm not entirely sure I understand his second law and so let's move on.\n\n  The second answer is by <PERSON>.\n\n  His second law is the standard second law. <PERSON> claims that he's defining force and mass but he doesn't (well he does seem to imply that given a known force that mass is just a constant of proportionality in the last sentence of his third-to-last paragraph before the additional remarks -- but without a way of measuring force, it's not useful) -- so that's a bit disappointing.\n\n  <PERSON> then defines force as the time derivative of momentum.\n\n  Even if we leave force as a primitive we still need a method of measuring the mass of an object in any given system. His method of defining it in a system of two particles doesn't work if we have more than two particles so it has a very limited applicability.", "a1_documentID": "4e4c584e-3052-5d5a-8b0a-56fe60fb417a", "a1_authorID": "a01cd4d4-3e4e-4ab3-f774-433cbde85144", "a1_style": "", "a2_fullText": "Weighing Plants\n\nIntroduction: Weighing Plants\n\n    It's quite difficult to determine when you should be watering your house plants.

The equation of motion as long as $\\dot x(t)<0$ is given by $$m\\ddot x=-kx+F$$\n\n  What happens at $t=0$? We should distinguish $F < kA$ and $F \\geq kA$. In the case $F > kA$, suppose that the mass starts to move with $\\dot x(0)<0$, the friction will immediately start pulling the mass to higher $x$. As soon as $\\dot x(0)>0$, the friction force will start pulling again to smaller $x$ and so on. The net effect of this continuous change of sense of the friction force will be that the mass will be at rest, given that the spring repelling force is dominated by the friction force. This reasoning is also true for $F=kA$. Conclusion, the mass is at rest for $F \\geq kA$.\n\n  What about the case where $F < kA$? in this case the friction is not dominating the repelling force of the spring. We should solve the equation piecewise, considering every time a time interval where $\\dot x(0)$ and hence $f$ do not change sign.\n\n  The solution for the first phase is $$ x(t) = (A-\\frac{F}{k})cos(\\omega t) + F/k $$ with $\\omega^2 = k/m$. This first phase comes to an end when $\\dot x (t)=0$. This happens at $\\omega t=\\pi$. At that moment $x=-A+2F/k$. The equation of motion then becomes $$m\\ddot x=-kx-F, (\\pi < \\omega t < 2\\pi ) $$ which, taking into account the initial conditions, has as solution $$ x(t) = (A-\\frac{3F}{k})cos(\\omega t) - F/k $$. At $\\omega t = 2\\pi$, we get $$x=A-\\frac{4F}{k}, \\dot x = 0$$. We are now back in the same situation as in the very beginning, except that $A$ has been replaced by $$A-\\frac{4F}{k}$$. So, what we see is that the amplitude diminishes with $2F/k$ over a period of time $\\pi/\\omega$. Phase $n$ will extend from $\\omega t=(n-1)\\pi$ to $\\omega t=n\\pi$ and the equation of motion will be $$ x(t) = (A-\\frac{(2n-1)F}{k})cos(\\omega t) - (-1)^n\\frac {F}{k} $$\n\n  This process of dissipating energy and decreasing amplitude goes on until at a certain point the friction force starts dominating the repelling force of the spring, which means that the body will come to rest (cf. beginning of this answer). This will happen at the end of phase $n$ where $n$ is given by $$F>k(A-\\frac{2nF}{k})$$ of or the lowest $n$ for which $$n>\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{Ak}{F}-1)$$ General conclusion: as long as the friction is not dominating the repelling force of the spring, i.e. as long as the amplitude is high enough, i.e. $>F/k$, the system will dissipate such that every $\\Delta t=\\pi/\\omega$, the amplitude decreases with $2F/k$. At a certain point, the amplitude has been reduced up to the point where the friction starts to dominate and then the body comes to rest.\n\n  The picture below shows the evolution of the position of the mass as a function of time for the case $A=13F/(2k)$.", "a3_documentID": "c6ef81cb-2f76-5871-abc5-4a4b027803b9", "a3_authorID": "4173f03e-e68a-0b2e-01d0-dd44054fe429", "a3_style": "", "overall_exp": "", "model_pred": ""}}, {"data": {"Q_fullText": "Did <PERSON> have to change his long-term plans for the X-Men in the early '90s?\n\nDuring the early '90s comic book industry boom, the X-Men received a massive overhaul and a new #1 issue, one that would go on to become the Guinness-certified official best-selling comic book of all time. X-Men #1, with a cover date of October 1991, marked the return of the original five X-Men to the team (they were previously members of X-Factor) and the creation of the Blue and Gold teams that most casual '90s fans remember. <PERSON> classic redesigns also debuted in this issue; those are the looks that would be used for the '90s animated series.\n\n  But the trading cards published at this time tell a completely different story.\n\n  The Marvel Universe Series 1 trading card set (1990) has two X-Men team cards. One is for \"their most powerful lineup\", a classic one from around Uncanny X-Men #200 (1985).\n\n  The other card depicts what it calls the \"latest roster\" as of 1990. The problem is, it's a roster that never even came close to appearing in the title.\n\n  Regarding the Uncanny X-Men roster for 1990, there wasn't one. This card was published during a time when <PERSON> and <PERSON> were following former X-Men on solo adventures. But this doesn't appear to be a placeholder card meant to represent the various characters being featured in Uncanny X-Men for a number of reasons:\n\n    * <PERSON> did not make his first appearance until late 1990\n    * <PERSON> did not appear in an X-Men comic until the very end of 1990, and then he was portrayed as a brainwashed Genoshan Magistrate\n    * <PERSON> is listed as a member even though his last appearance ever was a year before this\n    * <PERSON> only appeared in one issue of Uncanny X-Men in 1990, and it was not as a member of a team\n\n  On top of having a trading card made, this same roster even had promotional art made for it, adding in Beast (below is a modern, recolored update of the 1990 image).\n\n  Without knowing the actual release dates of the trading card set, it's hard to determine what comics they were basing this roster off of. However, the problem persists in the Marvel Universe Series 2 trading card set from 1991, the same year that the iconic X-Men #1 was released.\n\n  This one is also problematic because even though it doesn't reflect the roster that debuted in late 1991 (which is understandable, as this set was probably made in late 1990/early 1991), it does not even depict the set-in-stone, definitive roster that starred in Uncanny X-Men prior to the late 1991, <PERSON> relaunch with X-Men #1. The trading card should have looked like:\n\n  Granted, the only differences are <PERSON>'s inclusion and the lack of team uniforms. But again, why was <PERSON> included when, again, he was a brainwashed Genoshan Magistrate at the time? Was he intended to be part of this lineup after that storyline?\n\n  My question is, do these rosters represent ideas that <PERSON> had for the future of the X-Men before it was decided to launch a <PERSON>-driven X-Men #1 in late 1991?

The Gold Team starred in the long-running Uncanny X-Men series and consisted of <PERSON>, <PERSON>, <PERSON>, <PERSON> and <PERSON> (with <PERSON> joining shortly after their formation).

The X-Men become prisoners on Genosha, an island built on the backs of mutant slaves. This is a more loose adaptation from the source material, more using elements than strict plot.\n\n    * 11-12 Days of Future Past - Adapted from Uncanny X-Men #141-142 (1981). An mutant from the future (<PERSON> in the comics, <PERSON> in the cartoon) travels back in time with the help of another mutant (<PERSON> in the comics, <PERSON> in the cartoon) in an attempt to stop the assassination of Senator <PERSON> at the hands of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. <PERSON>'s assertion that <PERSON> is a traitor is also lifted from X-Men #8 (1992).\n\n    * 18 Repo Man - Adapted from Uncanny X-Men #109 (1978) and #120-121 (1979). <PERSON>'s original team, Alpha Flight, comes back to reclaim him.\n\n    * 19 X-Ternally Yours - Loosely adapted from X-Men #8-9, Ghost Rider #26-27 (1992).

Personally I intend to use mine in the feeding room attached to my ants nest, with sweet nectar on top of the clay ant so that I can admire the little darlings move up the legs to fetch it !\n\n  Supplies\n\n    TOOLS\n\n      * 100 g Air dry modelling clay (white used here, but any colour will work)\n      * Sparkling wine cages (4-5)\n      * Wire cutters\n      * Pliers\n      * Clay sculpting tools\n      * 60 cm twine\n      * Water\n      * Reference photo of an ant\n\n  Step 1: Making the Wire Frame\n\n    The first stage is to create the framework of an ant's body.\n\n    LEGS\n\n    Remove the bottom ring from 2 wine cages so all you have remaining are 4 legs and 1 ring.\n\n    Cut 2 legs off one of the rings, discard and attach the remaining part of the ring with its 2 legs to the whole ring with 4 legs.\n\n    Turn upside down.\n\n    Now it's time to shape the legs. Use a picture for reference to bend each leg into the necessary segments.\n\n    Trial and error: at any stage of the wire bending phase, you can bend the wire in different directions, back and forth, until you get it right.\n\n    ABDOMEN\n\n    Take a whole bottom ring off a wine cage, stretch it out, then curve it around to form the outline of the abdomen. Excess wire is weaved through the leg cage and attached to the frame.\n\n    The legs will have moved, but don't worry, they can be readjusted into position.\n\n    Take the twine and make a knot at the bottom of the abdomen cage. Wrap around the abdomen cage to form a more solid structure that the clay can attach to.\n\n  Step 2: Adding the Clay\n\n    Now comes the fun part.\n\n    Taking small balls of clay, add them to the abdomen cage until you reach your desired size. Always refer to your reference photo when shaping the ant with clay.\n\n    Take a small ball of clay to form the thorax. At this stage you may need to offset slightly the legs, away from the body, now that you've introduced the clay.\n\n    Don't be afraid to squeeze the inner body frame to create a narrower body, as you may find once you add the clay, the body is too wide compared to an actual ant.\n\n    TIP: Work on 1 body part at a time. Once you feel that the shape of that body part is correct and compares well to your reference photo, move onto the next part.\n\n    Keep adding and removing clay as and when needed, using the sculpting tools to smooth out the clay, especially where there are junctions (e.g. legs to the main body).\n\n    Once you are happy with the shape of the thorax and abdomen and the legs are in position, make small clay sticks to envelope the legs.\n\n    TIP: If the clay is drying too quickly and starts to flake, dab on some water and add a fresh bit of clay to it.\n\n    The abdomen and thorax of an ant aren't attached directly, they have what is called a petiole, with some ants even having an additional post-petiole. To recreate this effect add a small amount of clay in between the abdomen and thorax. It cannot be as thin as what you see on an ant as it would compromise the overall structure.\n\n  Step 3: The Head of the Game\n\n    The final body part to create is the head.\n\n    Take a small ball of clay and flatten it slightly, with both sides creating a concave shape, larger on one side than the other (the side linking to the rest of the body of the ant).\n\n    Two tiny balls, flattened once again, will form the eyes. As usual do not hesitate to add water with the shaping tools in order for any newly added clay to stick to the ant.", "a3_documentID": "2c809f16-de98-58c9-a195-927adbd05b09", "a3_authorID": "c989c9d0-dec3-e4ac-bc31-8e7a228512ac", "a3_style": "", "overall_exp": "", "model_pred": ""}}, {"data": {"Q_fullText": "Reversible Hanging Basket Storage Pods\n\nIntroduction: Reversible Hanging Basket Storage Pods\n\n    These storage pods are a great way to get organized. This is a relatively beginner friendly project that can be customized to your liking! You can do the same fabric inside and out, a solid color and a pattern, two patterns, two solids- whichever combination you like! These stylish storage pods are reversible and only take 1/4 yard of fabric, which makes them a budget friendly sewing project as well.\n\n  Supplies\n\n    For this project, you will need:\n\n    1/4 yard of lining fabric (white in my case)\n\n    1/4 yard of outer fabric (floral pattern in my case)\n\n    1/4 yard felt\n\n    1/4 yard Wonder Under (Iron on)\n\n    Sewing machine\n\n    Coordinating thread\n\n    Pattern (see step 1)\n\n  Step 1: Download and Print the Pattern\n\n    This pattern is sized to fit on a fat quarter of fabric, but it can be sized up or down to make different sizes of pods. You can make a really big one to store blankets in, or a tiny little one just for your headphones. Whatever sized items you need to store, you can customize this pattern to make a pod that will fit it all.\n\n    Download each pattern piece and print them out.\n\n    If the download does not work for you, you should be able to use to download the pattern:\n\n    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qUMEJHvuRm_Wcg...\n\n  Step 2: Cut Out the Pattern\n\n    Cut the pattern out. For the darts on the basket piece, cut down one side of each triangle. It really doesn't matter which side you cut. Fold along the other line of each triangle to make little flaps.\n\n  Step 3: Cut Fabric, Felt & Wonder Under\n\n    Now that you have the patterns cut out, you'll need to cut the fabric, felt and Wonder Under.\n\n    Lay the pattern on your fabric and cut a piece that is slightly larger than the pattern. For the basket pieces, fold the fabric in half and lay the pattern so the edge of the basket lines up with the fold of the fabric.\n\n    You will need to cut one each:\n\n    Wonder Under: basket piece, bottom circle\n\n    White fabric: basket piece, bottom circle\n\n    Pattern fabric: basket piece, bottom circle, loop piece\n\n  Step 4: Iron on the Wonder Under\n\n    Wonder Under is a double sided heat activated glue that comes on a backing sheet. It is available in packages or on a bolt and is used to attach fabric to fabric when ironed.\n\n    Place the rough side of the Wonder Under on the wrong side of fabric square for the bottom circle. Iron according to the package directions the let the piece cool completely. Gently peel off the backing sheet from the Wonder Under and discard. Next, place the felt on ironing board then place the Wonder Under side down on the top of the felt square then iron again. Be mindful that felt will melt if it comes in contact with the iron. Once you iron again, the felt should be attached to the fabric.\n\n  Step 5: Cut Out the Pattern\n\n    Once all the white fabric is stabilized with Wonder Under and felt, pin the pattern to the fabric and carefully cut the pattern out. You may wish to lightly trace the pattern with pencil before cutting.\n\n    For the basket pieces, fold the fabric in half and pin through the pattern and both layers of fabric. Fold over the triangles and trace the darts onto the wrong side of the fabric.\n\n  Step 6: Sew the Darts\n\n    A dart is a little triangle sewed into fabric to make the fabric bend. This pattern has 8 darts per basket piece. To sew in the darts from the pattern, line up the lines of the triangles on the wrong side of the fabric and sew along the lines.\n\n    For the white fabric, trim each dart so there is less bulk on the curves of the basket.\n\n  Step 7: Sew Up the Back\n\n    Fold the patterned fabric in half, right sides together. Sew up the back of the basket piece, but leave a space in the sewing. This space will be used to turn the basket right side out. Refer to the pattern for approximate size of the hole that is recommended.\n\n  Step 8: Sew on the Bottoms\n\n    Fold the bottom circle in half and mark the middle edge of the circles by making a little clip with your scissors.", "Q_style": "", "Q_documentID": "52d99e83-4601-56a7-86d8-ef885383e5fd", "Q_authorID": "549a0961-9d75-46d0-6b45-8255c196fc37", "correct_idx": 2, "a0_fullText": "Executive Summary\n\nWelcome to my review of Cloudspire! This turned out rather lengthy, so here's a summary of my opinions on the game:\n\n- Its components are excellent\n- It suffers from undesirable randomness and some lack of player agency\n- It is a slightly \"unstable\" design, favoring strong offense with weaker defensive options\n- Its strategic depth does not justify its rules complexity\n\nOverall I rate it a 6 out of 10 when playing rules-as-written, but I think there are opportunities for house rules to simplify and hopefully improve the game. Note that I have only played player-versus-player mode and have not explored the solo or co-op modes, so this review only addresses the PvP experience. For more details, read on!\n\nImportant note: I have heavily edited this review from its original form in response to the fruitful discussion which ensued. The community has my thanks for supplying insight, rules corrections, and generally helping me clarify my views on the game. If you care about the differences from the version people were originally responding to, you can view them here.\n\nOverview/Lore\n Cloudspireis a tabletop implementation of a MOBA-style video game such as League of Legends. In the game, you are the proud owner of a fortress perched upon a floating island. From this edifice marches forth your vast hordes of hapless and unintelligent minions, all of whom are driven by a single overwhelming desire to march in the general direction of your enemy's fortress while taking a whack at anything they encounter along the way. In addition to these your mindless minions, you will also send forth heroes, which you can (for the most part) directly control and use to explore the landscape, destroy landmarks, level up, and generally harass the enemy.\n\nThe floating island upon which you reside is powered by a mysterious essence called \"source\". Besides keeping islands afloat, source also has mind-altering and performance-enhancing qualities when ingested by the island's inhabitants. As such, when the source starts to run low, even the most peaceful of races becomes willing to kill everybody else to ensure they can continue satisfying their own chemical dependency.\n\nHappily, source also provides you with the ability to build \"spires\" amidst the mayhem. Spires are static defensive towers designed to shoot at any enemy foolhardy enough to wander within range. With source you can also add upgrades to your fortress, making your minions and heroes more powerful and versatile.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe game is played over the course of four \"waves\". In each wave, you receive a certain (increasing) amount of source with which to build spires and upgrades or purchase items and units from a common market. You also receive an increasing number of \"command points\", or CP, which you use to select the minions and/or heroes to deploy in this wave. After all players are done purchasing and have selected which units to deploy, the \"onslaught\" begins and the units march toward the enemy.\n\nFor the most part, you don't have much choice in where the minions move; they must make progress toward the enemy gate. Small deviations are possible depending on the terrain, and this is one area where the game provides tactical options. Figuring out the right order in which to deploy minions and moving them craftily can give you an edge over your opponent.\n\nHeroes, unlike minions, can move freely at your direction, opening up more opportunities for exploration and ambushes.\n\nEach unit has health, attack, and movement stats. Some have ranged attacks, and most have one or more special abilities.\n\nWhen a unit attacks, it deals damage equal to its attack value. If the defender is able, it will retaliate, dealing its own attack value as damage back upon the attacker. Most units, when defeated, provide the opponent with a reward - usually some quantity of source, but it could also be a \"relic\" (special card granting additional powers) or the option to build a spire for free.\n\nIf and when a unit reaches the opponent's fortress gate, it will attack the gate (which also retaliates). Each gate starts with 10 health, and when the health reaches zero, the fortress is defeated.\n\nIn addition to the faction units belonging to each player, there are also \"landmark\" chips placed face down on the map at the beginning of the game. During the game, after your units move they may explore and reveal any adjacent landmarks. This might introduce new hostile neutral minions to fight or other game effects such as a teleporter.\n\nOpinions\n\nEverybody raves about the components of this game, and rightly so - it is very well produced. The game board is a set of neoprene (mousepad material) mats, and the game pieces are stickered poker chips which have a nice weighty feel.", "a0_documentID": "efdda3c0-a200-5a7d-8d82-6b051913691d", "a0_authorID": "4dc53281-b57b-1cb8-aaae-f26e828f5291", "a0_style": "", "a1_fullText": "One Year On: Uzbekistan\u2019s Unhappy Ex-Ruling Family \u00b7 Global Voices\n\n<PERSON>.

They sneak around checking to make sure everyone is on their best behavior...\n\n    If you're looking for a fun new accessory to gift to your elf, check out this little basket! With just a few supplies, you can make your own tiny basket that will give your elves something festive to carry around their loot in!\n\n  Supplies\n\n    For this project you will need:\n\n    Pattern (see step 1)\n\n    Printer and cardstock\n\n    Craft wire (20 gauge)\n\n    Spray paint\n\n    Wire cutters\n\n    Epoxy\n\n    Fabric glue (I used Alieen's Fabric Fusion)\n\n    Twine, about 2 yards\n\n    Spool of thread\n\n    Clips (optional but very helpful)\n\n    Starch (optional but very helpful)\n\n  Step 1: Download & Print Template\n\n    I created a template for this project to make it easy to replicate the project. Simply download and print the images out. This template includes sizes for the basket ribs, the handle and even cute signs to add on! Print on thicker card stock for best results.\n\n    If the download is giving you sizing issues, check out the file in Google Docs here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/184jkpidgx1p1Id--S2n77MI_gm7yEUWH37cxcIy_IN4/edit?usp=sharing\n\n  Step 2: Stiffen the Twine\n\n    You will need about 2 yards of twine for each basket. I thought the twine would be easier to work with if it was stabilized a little so I poured some Sta-Flo fabric starch into a bowl and soaked the twine for a bit. I gently squeezed out the excess starch and then hung the twine out to dry. This step is optional but it really did make the twine easier to work with and gave the basket some stability in the end, so I think it is worth the extra effort. If you don't have starch, you could achieve similar results with hair spray or maybe even watered down glue.\n\n    While the twine is drying, cut out all your pattern pieces and cut your wire to size.\n\n  Step 3: Mix Some Epoxy\n\n    You will need some strong glue for this project to hold the ribs of the basket in place while you weave. The strongest glue that I had on hand was epoxy. I tried hot glue and even E6000 to no avail, so epoxy was my last ditch effort to make these ribs stay put on the basket and it worked out great!\n\n    Mix the epoxy per the directions on the bottle. This step doesn't require very much glue, about a nickel sized dollop will do. I thoroughly mixed the epoxy up in a plastic container with a skewer and then blobbed it into the middle of the cut out wagon wheel template.\n\n  Step 4: Line Up the Spokes\n\n    Now we are ready to start building out the basket. Line up all the spokes with the lines on the template. The wires don't have to touch in the middle, but try to keep them equally distanced from each other in the middle. Make sure your wire is as straight as possible. One of the ribs will include the handle wire, it doesn't matter where the handle is placed as there is only one :) Once you are all done lining up the ribs, you should have something that looks like a decidedly sad dandelion.\n\n    At this point I realized my epoxy was seeping through the paper on the bottom so I moved it to a piece of parchment paper. I recommend starting out on a piece of parchment or wax paper so nothing sticks to something you don't want it to stick to and so you don't have to try to move the project while the glue is wet.\n\n    Place the basket bottom on top of the wires and gently squish everything down a little.\n\n    Let the epoxy cure completely, I left mine sit overnight. Don't rush this part as you really need the glue to hold the wires in place.\n\n  Step 5: Spray Paint the Wires\n\n    Once everything was dry, I spray painted the wires white on both sides. Let the paint dry completely between coats.\n\n  Step 6: Form Your Basket\n\n    This basket was designed to fit around a standard 1.5 inch spool of thread. It doesn't matter what color the thread is because you only need the spool of thread to form the basket shape around it.", "a2_documentID": "67fceab4-c19a-5bce-8172-395fb22b56fd", "a2_authorID": "549a0961-9d75-46d0-6b45-8255c196fc37", "a2_style": "", "a3_fullText": "Am I doing this right? Finding the time derivative of expectation value of momentum\n\nI am currently working through the problems in <PERSON> Intro to Quantum mechanics, with the goal of hopefully understanding how magnets work.\n\n  At the moment I am a little stuck on one of the early problems in the first chapter. And I would like a Hint about how to proceed.\n\n  The problem is to solve the time derivative of the expectation value of momentum of a particle. ie: $$ \\frac{d\\left\n\n  }{dt}. $$\n\n  My working so far\n\n  Just prior to that question the text gives an expression for momentum, $$\\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}{\\Psi^*\\left[-i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right]\\Psi}dx, $$ (Where $\\Psi$ is a function satisfying <PERSON>'s equation, $i$ is the square root of negative 1, and $\\hbar$ is <PERSON>'s constant divided by $2\\pi$.)\n\n  So my initial approach was to try and differentiate this with respect to $t$. $$ \\frac{d}{dt}\\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}{\\Psi^*\\left[-i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right]\\Psi}dx. $$ However I didn't know how to do that, so I asked around in the maths chatroom, and got a lot of help. Specifically this strategy from @RobJohn: $$ \\begin{align} \\int vv'\\,\\mathrm{d}x &=vv-\\int vv'\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\ &=\\frac12vv+C \\end{align} $$\n\n  So I suppose it would follow that, $$ \\begin{align} \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}{ \\left( \\Psi^ \\left[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\right] \\Psi \\right) }\\,\\mathrm{d}x &= \\left[\\Psi^ \\cdot \\Psi\\right]{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} - \\int\\limits{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} {\\Psi\\frac{\\partial \\Psi^}{\\partial x} }\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\ &= \\frac{1}{2}|\\Psi|^2 \\Big|{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}, \\end{align} $$ And then, $$ \\begin{align} &\\frac{d}{dt}\\int\\limits{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}{\\Psi^\\left[-i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right]\\Psi}dx \\&=-i\\hbar \\frac{d}{dt}\\left( \\frac{1}{2}|\\Psi|^2 \\Big|_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\right). \\end{align} $$ But this feels wrong.

She also took part in the first demonstrations against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), the jihadist group that has taken over the areas free of regime control and imposed its own agendas on the population. When activists in Raqqa decided that gathering in front of the ISIS headquarters was too dangerous, <PERSON> decided to protest alone, becoming a one-woman demonstration and a symbol of the Syrian uprising.\n\n    <PERSON>, surrounded by her banners. Source: Syria Untold\n\n  The one-woman demonstration\n\n  <PERSON>, who majored in Education in 2006, has gone through her own personal revolutionary process since the beginning of the uprising. She has gone from facing the regime to dealing with extremist groups trying to profit from the power vacuum, as well as having to face her own family, who did not agree with her activism.\n\n  When asked by Syria Untold about how her activism has affected her family, <PERSON> said:\n\n  \u201cMy family has told me to stop and they say they will not forgive me if something happens to them. Of course I am worried about this, but Syria needs us all now. How can we abandon our country when it needs us the most?\u201d\n\n  She seems determined not to abandon it, and continues to raise her home-made banners both in front of the ISIS headquarters and through the streets and markets of Raqqa. Her very critical and straightforward messages include \u201cOur revolution was triggered by honorable people, and it is being stolen by thieves\u201d, \u201cRelease all detainees\u201d, and \u201cWhere were you when the crimes of Ghouta happened? Sleeping in your palaces?\u201d (Ghouta is an area in the outskirts of Damascus whose population suffered chemical weapons attacks in August 2013, which caused the death of hundreds of civilians, many of them children).\n\n  Other banners send a clear message to those using religion to oppress people:\n\n  \u201cMuslims spilling the blood of Muslims are sinners\u201d, \u201cOur enemy is the criminal regime, not the people\u201d, and \u201cDon't talk so much about religion. Show us your religion through your decency, your compassion and your good deeds.\u201d\n\n  When asked about ISIS, she insists that these groups are no different from the <PERSON> regime that they had to endure for so long.\n\n  \u201cThey burn churches, shoot at people, and impose their decisions on the population, how is that different from the regime?\u201d\n\n    <PERSON> with a child and one of her banners in Raqqa. Source: <PERSON> page.\n\n  \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave my city\u201d\n\n  As previously reported on Syria Untold, ISIS has engaged in raising the group's black flag to replace the popular revolution flag in demonstrations, imposing sectarian slogans, desecrating Christian saints\u2019 graves and destroying churches and cultural symbols such as the statue of poet and philosopher <PERSON>, known for denouncing religious superstition and dogmatism. This has created outrage among activists, who saw their revolution being hijacked by groups that are far from representing the diversity of their country and the population\u00b4s demands.\n\n  Standing up to ISIS has caused <PERSON> to be the subject of constant attack and threats. She was even shot at in front of the ISIS headquarters, an episode that she managed to survive with the help of her sister.\n\n  \u201cNo matter what happens, I want to stay. I want to stay in my city, I don't want others to take over it. Online activism is good, but there is work that has to be done on the ground, and some of us have to stay to do it.\u201d\n\n  <PERSON>\u2019s courage has inspired others and ignited solidarity with the \u201cone-woman demonstration\u201d from all over the country, especially from other women.

You may use a stencil if you'd like!\n\n    Then with an small pointed brush start to fill in the deer outline using black paint.\n\n    With the same small brush draw out the antlers.

The answer says that they can, but typically (ghosts) do not reveal themselves; partly because they want to be left alone, but also partly because they fear \"punishment\" by the Ministry.\n\n  My question is, what \"punishment\" could you give a ghost, or, more accurately, how do you make the ghost want to suffer the punishment rather than whatever else you could do to it? For example, we humans go to jail or do community service because if we don't, the other things the [insert location here] government could do to us would hurt more.\n\n  As an example, the answer I referenced says the Ministry made Moaning <PERSON> go back to her bathroom, but what I am asking is what could it do to her that would make going back to her bathroom preferable? Ghosts are already dead, so you can't kill them again (or can you?), and they are incorporeal, though probably not completely intangible.\n\n  We know from Chamber of Secrets, the book, that ghosts can taste and presumably feel, though barely, as a ghost at Nearly Headless Nick's Deathday Party (which is sadly not in the movie) has to float his head through some type of rotten, spicy food to taste any flavor at all.\n\n  However, this doesn't seem to be able to extend very far. Yes, the ghost feels things, so one could perhaps put the ghost in an electric torture chamber or something similar if he/she does not comply, but would they really want to do that for every <PERSON>-like manchild poltergeist? Is there perhaps a <PERSON>-style ghost container, able to vacuum up ghosts and put them in solitary confinement, or a <PERSON>-like \"ghost world\" (probably separate from the Veil) where they could store unruly ghosts?\n\n  One thing I know could make a ghost hurt would be to isolate the ghost from other people/ghosts. Humans are social creatures, and I assume ghosts are the same way, even considering how they are not completely human. However, again, this could only go so far, and some humans and ghosts would love nothing more than to be left alone, so exile would be like a reward for killing innocent humans and causing too much ruckus, rather than a punishment.", "a2_documentID": "0207deb2-99df-5db6-8402-c140d27d7b7c", "a2_authorID": "ea9d75b1-b561-a7a9-ab7a-af021528aedf", "a2_style": "", "a3_fullText": "El Salvador:  A Computer in Ecuador Stirs Up Salvadoran Presidential Campaign \u00b7 Global Voices\n\nA computer file purportedly discovered on a laptop computer at a guerrilla camp in Ecuador, has bloggers in El Salvador wondering what impact it will have and what impact it should have on the upcoming elections in their country scheduled for March 2009. The laptop computer was taken in the Colombian army's raid on the camp of FARC guerrillas in Ecuador. In that raid the number two man of the FARC, <PERSON>, was killed, and his computer seized.\n\n  The furor in El Salvador started when the Spanish newspaper El Pais disclosed[es] that one document on the computer referred to a Salvadoran making an introduction in 2007 from the FARC to Australian arms dealers. The Salvadoran named was <PERSON>, a senior official of the left-wing Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front (FMLN) and member of the Central American parliament. The conservative press in El Salvador played up the story with prominent pictures showing <PERSON> beside the FMLN's presidential candidate <PERSON>.\n\n\n\n\n  Photo by <PERSON> and used under a Creative Commons license.\n\n  Bloggers in El Salvador have been writing about how this story could impact the presidential campaign of <PERSON>. Blogger <PERSON> wrote a post [es] which put the issue in the context of the campaign strategy of the ruling right-wing ARENA party. According to <PERSON>, ARENA is trying to convince the \u201cswing\u201d voter. This is the person who is currently inclined to vote for the FMLN and <PERSON>, but is not a party militant and would not vote for the FMLN if convinced that \u201cFMLN = [Venezualan president <PERSON>.\u201d But the strategy is shifting with the disclosure of the FARC computer files:\n\n  Por lo que se v\u00e9, la estrategia la han cambiado un poco dados los acontecimientos, ahora la tesis me imagino que es FMLN = FARC, pero como lo expuse anteriormente, nuestro pueblo tiene una memoria coyuntural y toda esta publicidad y cobertura medi\u00e1tica actuales sera pronto olvidada.\n\n  Si en realidad hay algo de verdad en todas las acusaciones, se deben ejecutar las acciones legales pertinentes de parte de los paises que se consideren ofendidos e iniciar los juicios legales que correspondan, pero si solo se queda en la pura propaganda, se demostrar\u00e1 que s\u00edmplemente se trata de estrategias electorales.\n\n    What one sees now, the strategy has changed a bit given events. Now I imagine that the thesis is FMLN = FARC, but as I stated earlier, our people have a short-term memory and all this publicity and media coverage will soon be forgotten.\n\n    If indeed there is some truth in all accusations, the relevant legal actions should be implemented on the part of countries deemed offended and they should initiate appropriate legal proceedings. But if it only stays in the realms of pure propaganda, it will demonstrate that the [media focus] was just electoral stratagems.\n\n  The writer at the blog Salvadorans in the World [es] sees the repetition of the regular themes of Salvadoran politics in this story:\n\n  Y es aqu\u00ed d\u00f3nde las principales fuerzas pol\u00edticas salvadore\u00f1as se enfrentaran en una guerra de acusaciones e insultos. El FMLN dir\u00e1 que todo esto es un montaje, un show, una estrategia m\u00e1s de la derecha para mantenerse en el poder. Por otro lado, ARENA volver\u00e1 a repetir la misma historia, que el FMLN tiene nexos con grupos que no benefician en ning\u00fan modo al pa\u00eds, bla bla bla, etc. En la guerra de acusaciones e insultos, las propuestas para sacar al pa\u00eds adelante quedar\u00e1n relegadas a un tercer o cuarto plano.\n\n  En este escenario adverso, <PERSON> deber\u00eda dar se\u00f1ales inequ\u00edvocas que tiene criterios propios, y m\u00e1s importante, que tiene suficiente independencia de los comandantes en el FMLN para pedir que se investigue a fondo las acusaciones.", "a3_documentID": "027496c1-1402-598e-aab0-d30a0eaa0169", "a3_authorID": "04956594-9077-7fc4-7330-43525c923d87", "a3_style": "", "overall_exp": "", "model_pred": ""}}]
